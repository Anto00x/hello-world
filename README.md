# hello-world
My first repository (for the tutorial)

Hi, I work now as a front end developer for a major consulence company.
I am still very interested in reading other people's code to learn to program properly.
I have intermediate knowledge of Python, even if I don't use it currently.
I have intermediate knowledge of Javascript, and good knowledge of html and css, including scss.
I have basic knowledge of Angular and I am planning to learn to use React.
